Operating system functions
One main function of any operating system is turning the computer on and off.
While this can also be done through the hardware present in the computer through the physical switch on the pwer supply, the operating system has to also be able to do it itself.
An operating system on a computer will be linked to the on/off button on the front of the computer, and on a phone the OS will be linked to the power button as well.
An OS will also be able to have functionality for starting/turning off/restarting the computer through the Start Menu on Windows computers.
